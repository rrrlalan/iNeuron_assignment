###1. Download vechile sales data -> https://github.com/shashank-mishra219/Hive-Class/blob/main/sales_order_data.csv

--> Downloaded into my pc

#2. Store raw data into hdfs location

--> Step 01 : Copy data from my pc into docker container
'''
 docker cp sales_order_data.csv d852e:/opt/lln/
'''

--> Step 02 : Copy data from docker container into hdfs location
'''
hadoop fs -put /opt/lln/sales_order_data.csv /my_file/
'''

#3. Create a internal hive table "sales_order_csv" which will store csv data sales_order_csv .. make sure to skip header row while creating table
'''

#4. Load data from hdfs path into "sales_order_csv"
